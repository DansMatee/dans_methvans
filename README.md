# dans_methvans
A Meth Van script for players to cook on the go.

## Requirements
- A working server running ESX v1 final
- MythicNotify
- ProgressBars

## Getting Started
Drag and drop the script into your resources folder and add 'start dans_methvans'

When in game, players need to be seated in the backseat of the vehicle. 
Once they are there and possess all the required items, pressing 'G' will start the cooking process.

Items that are added are listed below.
- Meth Recipe: This item can be used to see the required items.
- Ammonia: Needed for cooking.
- Methylamine: Needed for cooking.
- Empty Baggies: Needed for cooking.
- Water: Needed for cooking.
- Beer: Needed for cooking.
- Matchbox: Needed for cooking.
- Meth Bag: Reward for cooking.

The amounts that are needed can be found through the Meth Recipe item.

## Configuring the Script
All the files are commented as best as I possibly could make them.

To change all timers and amounts of items needed to create the meth, as well has how many meth bags the player gets, check the config.lua
Changing the actual items required is a bit more tricky and not recommended for people who are unsure of what they are doing. (It's possible though)
